# LiteCLIP
This repository aims to explore the CLIP paper by OpenAI with light models and dataset.


Largely inspired by the repo [liteCLIP](https://github.com/shreydan/liteCLIP), the only goal of this repo is to reimplement things for better understanding.

# Dataset
* Flickr 8k dataset

# References
* CLIP [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.00020) and [code](https://github.com/openai/CLIP) by OpenAI.
